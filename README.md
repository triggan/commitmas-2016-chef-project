Welcome to Commitmas 2016! 

We will be building out a few cookbooks and resoures that will assist in deploying LAMP stacks into docker objects. This doesn't need to be a single cookbook, but we can build out different cookbooks as we see fit. 

The goal of this commitmas is to learn Git and the processes associated with that.


For our project, I would like things to be branched off the main repo and then pull requests submitted. If you would like to fork it, that is ok as well to help you understand how that works. 

A couple of extra pointers: 

- Please make sure to test your cookbook changes through Test Kitchen.
- You can download the Chef DK at https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/
- If you don't have it, you can get Test Kitchen at http://kitchen.ci and read their document on how to install and use the product. Should include Vagrant also, but just in case you can find that here: https://www.vagrantup.com
- Please read up on some basic Ruby to get an understanding of the cookbooks. This isn't specifcly to learn Chef, but knowing Chef does help
- Reach out to us if you have ANY questions. I'm in the Commitmas Slack under #commitmas-team-chef
- If you want to expand the project then please do. Just make sure to test and validate before submitting your pull request. 


Please let me know if you have any questions and happy coding and make your commits! 

Thanks,

Jesse
